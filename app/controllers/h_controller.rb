#3. In the next treatment, the players will have more help with their proofreading task. They will be provided with dropdown boxes with suggestions of how to correct the errors. I imagine it will look like this:
# a.   
# b.  These suggestions will each have a cost to the player. 
# i.  Was  5pts
# ii. Were 10 pts
# iii.  Wasnâ€™t 2 pts
# iv. Etc.
# c.  The cost to the player will need to be reported above the finish button
