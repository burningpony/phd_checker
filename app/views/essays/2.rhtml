							Megan held back the tears of frustration the entire car ride home.  She didn't say a single word while her father insisted that her health was the most important thing to consider right now. She knew on some level that he was right, but the stakes were too high for her. To him, it was just a game, but it wasn't just a game she was missing.  It was a chance to fulfill a dream she'd had for years, and while missing one game didn't actually mean losing that dream, Megan could not help thinking the worst.  She couldn't deny, however, that she felt horrible.  She went to her room to <span id="4_1" class="correctme" rel="laid">lay</span> down while her father speed-dialed her doctor.  She desperately wanted to play in the soccer match this afternoon, but the pain in her side was just too much to bear.  She hoped that perhaps she would feel better in a few hours, well enough, at least, to cheer on her teammates.  She hadn't missed a game so far this season, which was impressive considering her frequent illnesses.

							To say that her father was concerned would be an understatement. Her history of sudden and mysterious illnesses had left her father nervous and overprotective.  She started getting sick a few years ago, and after the fourth trip to the emergency room, her father realized that he had to keep tabs on her as much as possible.  His concern for his daughter's health completely circumvented any sense of decorum or boundaries he once had.  His public inquiries about her symptoms were often very specific, which <span id="4_1" class="correctme" rel="gradually">gradually</span> led people at school to suspect that something was terribly wrong with her.  More than once he had interrupted one of her classes just to check up on her.  He was on quite familiar terms with the school nurse, her coaches, the principal,  and most of the administrative staff.  He kept a list of Megan's friends, their parents, their phone numbers, and addresses in case he couldn't reach her.  It seemed like everyone knew Megan's father.  She became the poor girl who has "health problems" and a nervous father.

							This was not the ideal situation for an eleventh-grade mid-fielder with prospects of attending a division one school.  Most people were very sympathetic to her situation, but it wasn't the sympathy or the delicately asked "How are you?"s that bothered her-it was <span id="4_1" class="correctme" rel="her">her</span> promising, yet tenuous status as an athlete. Her father once spent almost an entire match pacing behind the team bench and firing questions at her as soon as she came within earshot.  She tolerated her father's slightly manic behavior, but lately, her patience had been wearing thin.  With rumors of talent scouts from top colleges attending play-off games, she had been eager to perform at her best that day. She couldn't risk losing her shot at a scholarship, but at the insistence of her father and the doctors he forced her to visit several times a month, she was trying to relax.
