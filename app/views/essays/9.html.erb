	The <span id="9_1" class="correctme quota" rel="sport">sport</span> of triathlon has captured the hearts and minds of many an athlete, weekend warrior, and once-and-future couch potato. It's allure partly <span id="9_2" class="correctme" rel="due">due</span> to the diversity of the sport but primarily due to how surprisingly accessible it is to non-athletes. Many an average person has decided to <span id="9_2" class="correctme" rel="do">do</span> a triathlon for health, personal enrichment, social, or other purposes.  But for most people just getting into the sport, it can <span id="9_3" class="correctme" rel="seem">seem</span> daunting both emotionally and financially.  It doesn't <span id="9_4" class="correctme" rel="have">have</span> to be as financially taxing as <span id="9_5" class="correctme" rel="people">people</span> might think. Depending on the expectations and goals of the individual, a triathlon can be enjoyed at levels that are fun and/or competitive even while on a <span id="9_6" class="correctme" rel="college">collage</span> student budget.

			The first consideration <span id="9_7" class="correctme" rel="for">for</span> the money-strapped aspiring triathlete is a decent pair of running shoes.  This item alone can cost upwards of $150-200, but traditionally it is one of the least expensive <span id="9_8" class="correctme quota" rel="items">items</span> on the triathlon budget report. <span id="9_9" class="correctme" rel="It's">Its</span> probably a good idea to start with the shoes because amateur athletes will spend the majority of their time running.  Contrary to what running fanatics will say, an amateur does not need a $100 <span id="9_10" class="correctme" rel="pair">pair</span> of running shoes to be happy in the sport.  There are many tales of extreme frugality like people training and competing in a $12 pair of Nikes purchased from a thrift-store.  As <span id="9_11" class="correctme" rel="long">long</span> as the shoe provides the <span id="9_12" class="correctme" rel="support">support</span> and comfort needed for a few six mile runs per <span id="9_13" class="correctme" rel="week">week</span>, it's a suitable shoe.  A regular shoe store will have an adequate selection of modestly priced shoes.  Check with runner <span id="9_14" class="correctme" rel="friends">friends</span> who may have recently upgraded to <span id="9_15" class="correctme" rel="the">the</span> latest release from Asics. Their old $150 pair with only 70 miles on it will suit any beginner triathlete.

			The next consideration <span id="9_16" class="correctme" rel="will">will</span> be the swimming aspect.  For many triathletes, swimming is <span id="9_17" class="correctme" rel="their">there</span> worst event, probably because most triathletes come from a cycling, running background.  Swimming is also the most location-restrictive element of training.  The most economical swimming location would be an open-water pond, lake, or river, but those beginners bound to land-locked areas or <span id="9_18" class="correctme quota" rel="cities">city's</span> should first check with local universities.  Many state universities with recreational swimming pools will offer public memberships for a nominal fee.  This will probably be the best value available unless one is employed at a company that allows for easy pool access.  Check with local YMCAs, and lastly, check with aquatic / athletic clubs.  Those will be the most expensive options but also the highest of quality. 
			The bicycle is definitely the most expensive item in any triathlete's arsenal. It can be fun to peruse the triathlon magazines and <span id="9_19" class="correctme" rel="drool">druel</span> over the $4,500 Cevelo frame, but for starters, any rode bike that fits will do. Depending on your degree of commitment, it doesn't even have to fit. The best advice for beginner triathletes regarding the purchase of a racing bike is check craigslist.org, ebay.com, and know what <span id="9_20" class="correctme" rel="you're">your</span> buying.  Buy a book on bike maintenance, read up, and be sure to check your purchases, ask the seller lots of questions, and be proud of how many people with more expensive bikes you <span id="9_21" class="correctme" rel="pass">past</span> during the race.
