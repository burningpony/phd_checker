						So many people today are worried that they're fat or they don't look good.  People are always trying to get the best clothes because they think it will <span id="7_1" class="correctme" rel="make">make</span> them look better to people. Some of this is because other people tell them that they don't look good.  They see other attractive people with nice clothes, so they think, "If I <span id="7_2" class="correctme" rel="wear">ware</span> nice clothes, I will look good too."  It seems like people only want to be with people who look skinny and pretty with <span id="7_3" class="correctme" rel="good">good</span> hair and smooth skin.  What makes it worse is that people have to see this on tv all the time, not just with shows that always have really attractive people on them, but with shows that are <span id="7_4" class="correctme" rel="supposed">suppose</span> to take ugly people and make them beautiful. TV shows like "What Not To Wear" are a part of the problem.  These kinds of tv make-over shows tell people that they have to look a certain way in order to be a good person, and that is just <span id="7_5" class="correctme" rel="plain">plain</span> wrong.

						TV make-over shows <span id="7_6" class="correctme quota" rel="are">are</span> very popular, and that is what makes them dangerous.  People like to watch them. They'll tell you that these shows are interesting to see what kinds of crazy clothes people have, and all the nice clothes that they get later.  People think that these shows really help people look <span id="7_7" class="correctme quota" rel="better">better</span> and feel good about themselves, but all these shows are based on the idea that these people are ugly.  These shows are really insulting to the <span id="7_8" class="correctme" rel="people">people</span> on them because they tell the person, "You're ugly, but <span id="7_9" class="correctme" rel="we're">were</span> going to fix it." Being ugly is not about how you look or what you wear. It's about the kind of personality you have.  It's about being a good person and treating other people fairly. These shows make people <span id="7_10" class="correctme" rel="think">think</span> that you're a good person only if you dress a certain way. 
							</p>
						<p>
						Another problem with these shows is that <span id="7_11" class="correctme" rel="they">they</span> force people to fit a certain style.  Most people on these shows would never care about fashion, and these shows force people to care about something they don't.  They change people into people they're not. If a person doesn't wear fancy clothes, there's probably a reason. Maybe it's not their style, or maybe they can't afford to <span id="7_12" class="correctme" rel="buy">by</span> expensive clothes.  There is nothing <span id="7_13" class="correctme" rel="wrong">wrong</span> with having clothes that feel comfortable and not wanting to have clothes that make it hard to <span id="7_14" class="correctme" rel="breathe">breath</span>. People need to be allowed to find their own style without the so-called "help" of reality make-over shows, which basically tell people what their style should be.  Style is whatever somebody wants it to be.  Reality shows tell people "You have no style," but that is wrong.  They have a style.  It's just not the same style you like.  These shows <span id="7_15" class="correctme" rel="try">try</span> to embarrass people into doing things they don't want to do.  If people don't like who they are on the outside, maybe they need to deal with it themselves, because only they can figure out why they don't like what they see.
